# Islands-and-Bridges
Japanese logic puzzle game (Hashiwokakero)

Description:
My project is called “Islands and Bridges.”  It is a program that allows users to play the Japanese logic puzzle game Hashi (aka Bridges).  My project contains three preset Hashi boards for the user to solve (called “Practice 1,”  “Practice 2,” and “Practice 3”) and it also has a feature that generates new boards automatically, both 7x7 and 9x9 boards. In addition, the program can check if the user has solved the puzzle and it can show the solution to the user or give the user a hint for how to get started solving the puzzle.


How to run the project:
To run the project, run the term-project.py file in an editor. The program uses cmu_112_graphics so make sure that is installed.


Shortcuts:
There aren’t really any shortcuts, except the “See Solution” button which allows you to skip to the solution of a puzzle and the “Get Hint” button which partially solves the puzzle.
